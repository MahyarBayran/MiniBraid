# MiniBraid

This is a personal project that I worked on (summer 2020) as a way to develop my Unity C# programming skills. 
I have been trying to imitate some of the game mechanics seen in the game "Braid" by Jonathan Blow. 
This is a work in progress and still needs some additional refinements and additional level designs. 
In future, I might also try some more complicated mechanics, such as the "time shadow" or the ring mechanic in Braid.
